## 💡 Demo Tips

### Opening Line
"Bagel is privacy-first payroll for Solana. Traditional payroll exposes everyone's salaries on-chain. We fix that with encrypted state, private transfers, and real-time streaming."

### Highlight This
- ✅ "Watch me create a real payroll right now..." (show wallet prompt)
- ✅ "Here's the transaction on Solana Explorer..." (show verification)
- ✅ "Now watch the balance stream every second..." (show streaming)
- ✅ "All while keeping salaries private using Arcium MPC..."

### Address Questions
- **Q: Is this real or mocked?**
  - A: Real transactions! Here's the explorer link.
  
- **Q: How do you ensure privacy?**
  - A: Four protocols: Arcium (encrypted state), ShadowWire (ZK transfers), MagicBlock (confidential streaming), Range (compliance).
  
- **Q: What's the business model?**
  - A: Take 20% of yield generated on idle payroll funds. Employers get 80% as a bonus.
  
- **Q: Why Solana?**
  - A: Speed (1 second balance updates), low cost (streaming payments), privacy tooling (4+ protocols).
